# Video Conferencing Negotiation: Effects on Outcomes

## 1. What Defines Video Conferencing Negotiation  
Video conferencing involves **synchronous, computer‑mediated communication** that transmits both audio and visual cues (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams). It preserves more social richness than text‐only media but lacks some of the immediacy and full nonverbal bandwidth of in‐person meetings.

## 2. Effects on Trust, Information Exchange, and Outcomes

- **Trust & Rapport**  
  Video conferencing restores facial expressions and tone of voice, which significantly **boost trust** compared to chat or email (Raveendhran, Zhang, & Dulebohn, 2022). However, slight delays and “flattened” eye contact can still hinder the deep rapport achievable face‑to‑face (Kock & Rocco, 2021).

- **Information Exchange & Creativity**  
  Studies find that negotiators on video share **more information** and generate **more integrative solutions** than those limited to text, but still slightly less than those who meet in person (Lipp & Mohnen, 2024; Raveendhran et al., 2022).

- **Satisfaction & Joint Gains**  
  Participants report **higher process satisfaction** and perceive agreements as fairer on video than via chat/email, though slightly lower than face‑to‑face (Lipp & Mohnen, 2024). Joint‐value outcomes on video approach those of in‑person negotiations when participants actively engage nonverbal cues (Raveendhran et al., 2022).

## 3. Pros and Cons vs. Other Media

| Aspect                    | Face‑to‑Face            | Video Conferencing                 | Chat / Email                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Nonverbal Cues**        | Full body + tone       | Facial + tone only                 | None                               |
| **Synchrony**             | Real‑time, fluid       | Real‑time, minor lags possible     | Chat: real‑time; Email: asynchronous |
| **Trust / Rapport**       | Highest                | High                               | Low                                |
| **Information Richness**  | Very high              | Moderate‑high                      | Low                                |
| **Practicality**          | Costly, travel needed  | Convenient, remote collaboration   | Highly convenient, low bandwidth   |
| **Satisfaction**          | Very high              | High                               | Moderate‑low                       |
| **Joint Gains**           | Highest                | Near‑high                          | Lower                              |

## 4. Best Practices for Video Conferencing

1. **Optimize Technical Setup**  
   - Use **high‑quality camera and microphone** to minimize lag and distortion (Kock & Rocco, 2021).  
   - Ensure **stable internet** and minimal background noise.

2. **Enhance Nonverbal Presence**  
   - **Maintain eye contact** by placing your camera at eye level.  
   - Use **open body language** and nod to signal active listening.

3. **Establish Ground Rules**  
   - Agree on **turn‑taking protocols** (e.g., raising hands, brief muting) to avoid crosstalk.  
   - Share an **agenda and visual aids** in advance to keep focus.

4. **Leverage Digital Tools**  
   - Use **screen‑sharing** for data and benchmarks to reinforce objective criteria.  
   - Annotate or use whiteboard features to **co‑create options** in real time.

5. **Build Warmth and Trust**  
   - Begin with **brief personal check‑ins** to humanize the interaction.  
   - Verbally **label positive moves** (“I appreciate your flexibility on the timeline”) to compensate for reduced tactile cues.

6. **Follow Up with Written Summaries**  
   - Immediately circulate a **concise recap** of offers, concessions, and next steps to ensure clarity and commitment.
