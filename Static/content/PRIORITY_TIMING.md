## Priority Disclosure Timing: Definition, Mechanisms, and Application

### 1. What Is Priority Disclosure Timing?  
Priority disclosure timing refers to **the strategic decision of when to reveal which issues (e.g., price, delivery schedule, service level) matter most to you** during a multi‑issue negotiation. Rather than laying out your issue‑ranking at the outset, you control the flow of information to preserve leverage and avoid giving the other party a roadmap to exploit your highest‑value items.

### 2. Why It Works  
1. **Information Asymmetry & Leverage**  
   - By withholding your exact priorities early on, you maintain **information asymmetry**, preventing a self‑interested counterpart from conceding minimally on low‑priority issues while demanding steep concessions on what matters most to you (Loschelder, Gaule, & Mussweiler, 2022).  
2. **Reciprocity and Trust Building**  
   - Gradual disclosure—linked to reciprocal concessions—fosters **trust** and encourages the counterpart to share their own priorities, enabling more balanced trade‑offs (Lewicki, Saunders, & Barry, 2015).  
3. **Avoiding Early Exploitation**  
   - Studies show that negotiators who reveal their issue hierarchy too soon often end up with **worse outcomes**, as opponents hone in on high‑value issues for aggressive concessions (Loschelder et al., 2022; Thompson & Malhotra, 2012).

### 3. How to Apply Priority Disclosure Timing  
1. **Prepare an Issue Map**  
   - List all negotiation issues and assign a *preliminary* priority ranking internally—do **not** share this ranking verbatim.  
2. **Start Broad, Probe Deeply**  
   - Begin with **open‑ended questions** (e.g., “Which aspects of this contract are most critical for you?”) to gauge the counterpart’s interests before revealing yours.  
3. **Use Conditional Disclosure**  
   - Link each piece of information about your priorities to a **small concession** on a lower‑priority issue.  
     > *Example:* “I can be flexible on delivery timelines if we can agree on a premium service fee range.”  
4. **Monitor Reciprocity**  
   - If your counterpart reciprocates by sharing their own priorities, you can justify revealing more of yours. If not, continue to withhold or reframe.  
5. **Time Your Full Reveal**  
   - Disclose your highest‑priority issues **only after** you’ve secured concessions on mid‑ and low‑priority items, or once trust has been established through early cooperative moves.

### Famous Real‑World Example: Dell & Intel Volume Rebates  
In the late 1990s, Dell Computer negotiated exclusive volume‑rebate agreements with Intel. Dell’s top priority was securing a significant per‑unit CPU price discount, but they withheld this priority during initial talks. Instead, Dell first committed to guaranteed volume forecasts and exclusivity (a lower‑priority issue), prompting Intel to lock in supply and capacity for Dell. Only after Intel agreed to multi‑year volume commitments did Dell reveal its need for deeper price cuts. By timing this disclosure, Dell maximized leverage—trading guaranteed volume for a larger discount than if they had revealed their rate targets upfront.
