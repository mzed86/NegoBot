# The Structure of a Negotiation for corporate professionals

Successful negotiations unfold in a series of coordinated stages. In this section, we introduce the four core components you will explore in detail on subsequent pages:

1. **Establishing Objectives**  
   Clarifying your **interests**, priorities, and fairness standards.  
   > A clear objective‑setting process ensures you focus on what truly matters—beyond price—to create lasting value (Lewicki, Saunders, & Barry, 2015).

---

2. **Establishing Boundaries**  
   Defining your **BATNA** (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) and reservation point.  
   > Knowing your walk‑away alternative gives you the confidence to reject suboptimal deals and anchors your reservation price (Fisher & Ury, 1981; Malhotra & Bazerman, 2007).

---   

3. **Generating Options**  
   Crafting multiple, creative **package deals** (MESOs) that expand value for all parties.  
   > Generating several equivalent offers simultaneously encourages integrative trade‑offs and reveals true preferences (Neale & Bazerman, 1992; Pruitt & Carnevale, 1993).

---

4. **Making Offers and Concessions**  
   Deploying **anchoring**, calibrated concessions, and reciprocity to claim and create value.  
   > Well‑timed first offers and planned concession patterns drive better outcomes while preserving relationships (Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001; Loschelder, Gaule, & Mussweiler, 2022).

Each of the following pages will delve into one of these components—explaining **what it is**, **why it works**, and **how to apply it**—with key studies, practical frameworks, and real‑world examples.
