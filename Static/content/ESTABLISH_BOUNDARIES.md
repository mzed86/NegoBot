# Establishing Boundaries: Understanding and Leveraging Your BATNA

### 1. What Is a BATNA?

BATNA stands for **Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement**. It is the most advantageous course of action a party can take if no agreement is reached in the current negotiation. Coined by Roger Fisher and William Ury in *Getting to Yes* (1981), BATNA is not just a fallback plan—it is a source of **power and leverage**.

“Establishing boundaries” means clearly knowing your walk-away point and the value of your best alternative. This allows you to negotiate with confidence and avoid agreeing to unfavorable terms out of fear or uncertainty.

### 2. Why It Works

1. **Increases Negotiation Power**  
   - A strong BATNA allows negotiators to say "no" credibly, which increases bargaining power and improves final outcomes (Fisher & Ury, 1981).

2. **Reduces Psychological Pressure**  
   - Knowing you have a viable alternative reduces anxiety and susceptibility to manipulative tactics (White & Neale, 1994).

3. **Helps Set Rational Reservation Points**  
   - BATNA acts as an **objective benchmark** against which to compare offers, enabling more principled decision-making (Pinkley, 1995).

4. **Improves Negotiation Outcomes**  
   - Empirical studies show negotiators who research and improve their BATNA before the negotiation **achieve better deals** and avoid post-agreement regret (Malhotra & Bazerman, 2007).

### 3. How to Apply BATNA Effectively: A Step‑by‑Step Guide

Turning BATNA from concept to concrete leverage requires a systematic process. Follow these steps to establish—and strengthen—your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement:

#### Step 1: Define Your Decision Criteria  
- Determine which factors matter most in your alternative (e.g., revenue, time to close, strategic fit, risk).  
- These criteria will guide your evaluation and comparison of options.

#### Step 2: Brainstorm All Possible Alternatives  
- List every option you could pursue if this negotiation fails:  
  - Other prospective clients or vendors  
  - Internal projects or assignments  
  - Subcontracting or partnerships  
  - Delaying the deal  

#### Step 3: Gather Data & Evaluate Each Alternative  
- For each alternative, estimate:  
  - **Value** (financial or strategic)  
  - **Cost** (time, resources, relationship risk)  
  - **Feasibility** (likelihood you can execute)  

#### Step 4: Compare Alternatives in a Table  
Using a simple decision table helps you see which option truly stands out as your BATNA. For example:

| **Alternative**               | **Estimated Value** | **Cost / Effort** | **Feasibility (1–5)** | **Notes**                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Client B consulting contract  | \$80K               | Medium            | 4                     | Requires 4‑week ramp‑up                   |
| Internal audit project        | \$60K               | Low               | 5                     | Immediately deployable, low overhead      |
| Subcontract with Partner XYZ  | \$70K               | High              | 3                     | Requires partner negotiation and vetting  |

> **Example Insight:** In this table, the **Internal audit project** has the highest feasibility (5) and lowest cost—making it a strong BATNA despite lower value.

#### Step 5: Select and Strengthen Your BATNA  
- Choose the alternative with the best balance of value and feasibility.  
- Take concrete steps to **solidify** it:  
  - Reach out to alternative clients for preliminary buy‑in  
  - Secure internal approvals or resources  
  - Finalize any necessary arrangements so your BATNA is credible

#### Step 6: Determine Your Reservation Price  
- Translate your BATNA’s value into a **reservation point**—the worst deal you’ll accept.  
- Any offer below this point should lead you to **walk away** and pursue your BATNA instead.

#### Step 7: Plan Your BATNA Communication  
- **Don’t reveal** your BATNA prematurely. Instead, signal strength by referencing your alternatives when advantageous:  
  > “We have the capacity to start an internal project in 2 weeks if we can’t agree on terms here.”  
- Use these hints to reinforce your reservation price without giving away full details.

### By following these steps and using a decision table, you turn an abstract “alternative” into a concrete, credible source of leverage—enabling you to negotiate confidently and avoid settling for suboptimal deals.

### Real-World Example: Microsoft’s Acquisition of LinkedIn (2016)

Before Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, LinkedIn explored other partnership and acquisition possibilities. By doing so, they established a BATNA that improved their negotiating position. Microsoft, understanding LinkedIn’s growth and LinkedIn knowing its strategic alternatives, led both parties to **negotiate a premium deal** that exceeded the value of their respective BATNAs.

### Practical Tools

- **BATNA Worksheet** (Harvard Program on Negotiation): Helps negotiators map alternatives, assess feasibility, and compare value.
- **ZOPA Analysis** (Zone of Possible Agreement): Use your BATNA to define your side of the ZOPA and test alignment with the counterparty’s expected range.
