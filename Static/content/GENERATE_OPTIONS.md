# Generating Options: Definition, Mechanisms, and Application

### 1. What Is Generating Options?  
Generating options is the proactive process of **brainstorming and presenting multiple potential agreements**—often as package deals—that can satisfy the interests of all parties. Rather than haggling over a single issue (e.g., price), negotiators **expand the solution space** by identifying creative combinations of trade‑offs across issues (e.g., price, service levels, payment terms).

### 2. Why It Works  
1. **Expands the Pie**  
   - By considering a variety of packages, negotiators uncover **value‑creating trades** that simple one‑issue bargaining misses (Pruitt & Carnevale, 1993).  
2. **Reveals True Preferences**  
   - Presenting **Multiple Equivalent Simultaneous Offers (MESOs)** allows counterparts to choose the package that best matches their priorities, signaling which issues they value most (Neale & Bazerman, 1992).  
3. **Builds Momentum**  
   - Offering options demonstrates **flexibility** and a collaborative spirit, which fosters reciprocal concessions and reduces impasse risk (Thompson, 1996).  
4. **Anchors Negotiation Frame**  
   - Well‑constructed option sets can **anchor the conversation** around integrative outcomes rather than positional demands (Curhan, Elfenbein, & Xu, 2006).

### 3. How to Apply Generating Options

1. **Brainstorm Without Judgment**  
   - In preparation, list all conceivable combinations of issue trade‑offs—price, volume, timeline, support, performance bonuses—without evaluating feasibility.  

2. **Develop MESOs**  
   - Create **2–4 package proposals** that are of **equal value to you** but differ in composition.  
     - *Example:*  
       - **Option A:** Higher price, shorter delivery time, premium support  
       - **Option B:** Mid‑range price, standard delivery, extended warranty  
       - **Option C:** Lower price, longer delivery, performance bonus on late penalties  

3. **Use Objective Criteria to Structure Options**  
   - Anchor each package to fair standards (market benchmarks, service‑level norms) to maintain legitimacy and defensibility.  

4. **Sequential Disclosure**  
   - Present your MESOs **simultaneously** rather than one at a time, to avoid conceding too much when you reveal each package.  

5. **Invite Counter‑Options**  
   - Encourage the other party to propose their own bundles, signaling a true partnership in solution design.

### Real‑World Example: Adobe Creative Cloud Enterprise Licensing

When Adobe transitioned to a subscription model, its sales teams generated multiple enterprise licensing options for large corporate clients:  
- **Option 1:** Full Creative Cloud suite at 20% volume discount + 24/7 dedicated support  
- **Option 2:** Core apps only (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) at 30% discount + annual training credits  
- **Option 3:** Custom hybrid bundle with à la carte apps + performance‑based rebates for adoption rates  

By offering these MESOs, Adobe discovered that some clients prioritized training and support over sheer app access, enabling deals that increased overall spend and customer satisfaction (Boudreau & Watson, 2021).
