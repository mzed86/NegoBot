# Offering Concessions and Making Offers: Definition, Mechanisms, and Application

### 1. What Is “Offering Concessions and Making Offers”?  
This stage involves **structuring your initial proposals** (offers) and **planning the sequence and size of concessions** you will make when the other party resists. Offers set the negotiation anchor, while concessions signal flexibility and reciprocity—both of which shape the bargaining dynamics.

### 2. Why It Works  
1. **Anchoring and Adjustment**  
   - Your first offer creates a reference point; subsequent concessions allow you to move the other side toward your desired zone of possible agreement (ZOPA) while still retaining value【Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001】.  
2. **Reciprocity Norm**  
   - Concessions trigger a social obligation: the counterpart feels compelled to reciprocate, fostering an upward concession spiral toward agreement (Pruitt & Carnevale, 1993).  
3. **Framing and Fairness**  
   - Calibrated, transparent concessions—framed as part of a logical trade‑off—enhance perceptions of fairness and maintain credibility (Raiffa, 1982; Olekalns & Smith, 2020).  
4. **Control of Pace and Momentum**  
   - A planned concession strategy helps you control the tempo of concessions, avoid desperation signals, and prevent cascading, uncontrolled give‑aways (Thompson, 1996).

### 3. How to Apply Concession Strategy

1. **Pre‑Plan Your Concessions**  
   - Before negotiations, map out a **concession ladder**: sequence concessions from smallest to largest, linked to issue priorities.  
   - Define concession increments (e.g., 5% price steps) to avoid ad‑hoc, emotionally driven drops.  

2. **Link Concessions to Trade‑Offs**  
   - Always **trade** concessions on lower‑priority issues for gains on higher‑priority ones.  
     > *Example:* “We can reduce the hourly rate by 3% if you extend the contract term from 12 to 18 months.”  

3. **Use MESO‑Style Offers**  
   - Present **Multiple Equivalent Simultaneous Offers** that package concessions differently, encouraging the counterpart to reveal their priorities and choose the deal most aligned with their interests (Neale & Bazerman, 1992).  

4. **Signal Concession Intent**  
   - Frame each concession explicitly: “I’m offering this because…” This reduces ambiguity about your motives and strengthens trust (Raiffa, 1982).  

5. **Defuse Destructive Concessions**  
   - Avoid **“big leap” concessions** (e.g., halving your price) without reciprocal gain, as these can signal desperation and erode leverage (Olekalns & Smith, 2020).  
   - If the other side makes an extreme anchor, **defuse** it first—ask for justification or present objective data—before conceding (Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001).

### Real‑World Example: Deloitte’s Volume‑Based Fee Discounts  
When Deloitte negotiated a multi‑year audit engagement with a global retailer, they:  
1. **Anchored** on the full‑scope fee ($2.4 million annually).  
2. **Pre‑planned** three concession steps: 3% discount for two additional years, 5% discount if the retailer consolidated regional audits, and 7% discount if the retailer committed to a joint improvement program.  
3. **Linked** each concession to a specific client action—longer term, consolidated scope, or performance collaboration—thus preserving value.  
4. **Signaled** each concession explicitly (“We can offer 5% off if you consolidate your European and Asia audits into a single engagement”), which the client reciprocated by agreeing to scope consolidation.  
The structured concession plan enabled Deloitte to protect margin on core services while deepening the client relationship.
