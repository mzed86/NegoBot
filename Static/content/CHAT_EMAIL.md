# Chat/Email Negotiations: Effects on Outcomes and Conclusion

## 1. What Defines Chat/Email Negotiation  
Chat and email negotiations occur through **text‑only, computer‑mediated channels**. Chat (synchronous) and email (asynchronous) strip away vocal tone and nonverbal cues, relying solely on written language to convey offers, questions, and concessions.

## 2. Effects on Trust, Information Exchange, and Outcomes

- **Reduced Trust & Rapport**  
  Chat/email participants report **lower perceived warmth** and trust compared to video or face‑to‑face settings. Without voice or visual signals, messages can seem terse or overly transactional, hindering relationship‑building (Parlamis & Ames, 2010).

- **Slower Information Exchange**  
  Asynchronous email in particular leads to **delays** in feedback and clarification, reducing momentum. Even synchronous chat is slower than spoken dialogue, which can constrain exploratory questioning and integrative problem‑solving (Lipp & Mohnen, 2024; Raveendhran, Zhang, & Dulebohn, 2022).

- **Lower Satisfaction & Joint Gains**  
  Field experiments find that chat/email negotiations produce **the lowest joint‑value outcomes** and participant satisfaction among common media, with fewer creative trades and more positional haggling (Lipp & Mohnen, 2024).

## 3. Pros and Cons vs. Face‑to‑Face and Video

| Aspect                  | Face‑to‑Face       | Video Conferencing    | Chat / Email         |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Nonverbal Cues**      | Full body + tone   | Facial + tone         | None                 |
| **Synchrony**           | Real‑time         | Real‑time (minor lag) | Chat: real‑time; Email: delayed |
| **Trust / Rapport**     | Highest            | High                  | Lowest               |
| **Information Richness**| Very high          | Medium‑high           | Low                  |
| **Practicality**        | Lowest             | Moderate              | Highest              |
| **Satisfaction**        | Very high          | High                  | Moderate‑low         |
| **Joint Gains**         | Highest            | Near‑high             | Lowest               |

## 4. Improving Outcomes in Chat/Email Negotiations

1. **Over‑Communicate Positive Signals**  
   - Use **polite salutations**, emojis or emotive language sparingly, and explicit statements of goodwill (e.g., “I appreciate your flexibility on this point”) to compensate for missing vocal cues (Parlamis & Ames, 2010).

2. **Structure Messages Clearly**  
   - Employ **bulleted lists**, headings, and numbered options (MESOs) to organize complex offers and facilitate quick comprehension (Neale & Bazerman, 1992).

3. **Set Expectations for Response Times**  
   - At the outset, agree on expected reply windows (e.g., within 2 hours) to maintain momentum and reduce frustration.

4. **Integrate Mixed Media**  
   - When possible, **escalate** from chat/email to a brief video call for critical junctures (anchoring, final offers) to rebuild trust and clarify misunderstandings (Lipp & Mohnen, 2024).

5. **Confirm Understanding Frequently**  
   - End each message with **summary confirmations** (e.g., “To confirm, we agree on X in exchange for Y, correct?”) to avoid ambiguities and ensure alignment.

6. **Use Objective Attachments**  
   - Attach **market reports**, benchmarks, and data tables to justify anchors and concessions, reinforcing fairness and legitimacy in the absence of nonverbal persuasion.

## 5. Conclusion

While chat and email offer unmatched convenience, their **lean communication bandwidth** can hinder trust, creativity, and satisfaction in negotiations. To mitigate these drawbacks, negotiators should consciously incorporate clarity, empathy signals, and periodic shifts to richer media. By doing so, even text‑only negotiations can approach the effectiveness of more “rich” channels and preserve opportunities for integrative value creation.
