## Perspective‑Taking: Definition, Mechanisms, and Application

### 1. What Is Perspective‑Taking?  
Perspective‑taking is the deliberate cognitive effort to **adopt the viewpoint of your counterpart**—imagining their thoughts, feelings, constraints, and motivations—without necessarily sharing their emotions. In negotiation, it goes beyond empathy (“feeling what they feel”) to actively **simulate their decision‑making process** and anticipate their likely reactions and priorities (Galinsky _et al._, 2008).

### 2. Why It Works  
1. **Enhanced Information Access**  
   - By mentally “walking in their shoes,” negotiators uncover hidden needs and constraints that counterparts may not volunteer (Galinsky & Moskowitz, 2000).  
2. **Better Issue Framing**  
   - Understanding how the other party frames problems lets you **re‑package offers** in terms they find most attractive—for example, emphasizing cost‑savings to a budget‑conscious buyer (Maddux _et al._, 2008).  
3. **Reduced Reactive Bias**  
   - Perspective‑taking attenuates automatic negative stereotypes and interpersonal defensiveness, leading to more cooperative exchanges (Galinsky & Moskowitz, 2000).  
4. **Superior Joint Outcomes**  
   - Experimental studies show that negotiators trained in perspective‑taking achieve **higher joint and individual gains** than those trained in empathy or those given no training (Galinsky _et al._, 2008).

### 3. How to Apply Perspective‑Taking  
1. **Structured Reflection**  
   - Before the negotiation, write answers to questions such as:  
     - *“What are their top three pressures right now?”*  
     - *“What alternatives might they pursue if talks fail?”*  
     - *“How will they justify a concession internally?”*  
2. **Role‑Reversal Exercises**  
   - In team preparation, assign each member to argue from the counterpart’s perspective for a few minutes. This “devil’s advocate” format helps surface arguments and objections you might otherwise miss (Ku, Wang, & Galinsky, 2015).  
3. **Mirroring and Labeling**  
   - During the talk, paraphrase the other side’s statements (“It sounds like securing long‑term volume is critical for you”) to confirm your understanding and prompt further disclosure (Voss & Raz, 2016).  
4. **Perspective‑Driven MESOs**  
   - Combine perspective‑taking with the MESO (Multiple Equivalent Simultaneous Offers) approach by crafting packages tailored to what you know of their preferences—e.g., one bundle emphasizes faster delivery, another emphasizes price concession—so they choose the option that best matches their perspective (Neale & Bazerman, 1992).  
5. **Ongoing Calibration**  
   - Throughout the negotiation, periodically **check your assumptions**: ask clarifying questions (“How does that timeline impact your internal targets?”) and adjust your mental model of their priorities.

### Real‑World Example: Nike’s Supplier Negotiations  
In the 2010s, Nike’s procurement teams began each vendor negotiation with a **“factory‑manager immersion”** workshop. Negotiators spent time on the factory floor—talking to plant managers about cash‑flow cycles, staffing constraints, and production bottlenecks. Armed with these insights, they renegotiated key terms: offering slightly longer lead times in exchange for 8–10% lower unit costs. By tailoring proposals to suppliers’ actual constraints, Nike secured better pricing without eroding trust or quality.
