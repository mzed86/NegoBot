# Negotiation Mediums: Introduction

Negotiation does not occur in a vacuum—**the communication medium** profoundly shapes interaction dynamics, trust, and outcomes. In this section, we will examine three primary formats:

1. **Face‑to‑Face**  
   The richest channel, combining verbal content with full nonverbal cues (body language, tone, facial expressions). Research consistently shows face‑to‑face negotiations yield higher trust, greater rapport, and more integrative agreements than mediated formats (Valley et al., 1998; Thompson, Nadler, & Kim, 2005).

2. **Video Conferencing**  
   A synchronous but computer‑mediated channel preserving visual and auditory signals. Video tools (e.g., Zoom, Teams) approach the social richness of in‑person meetings, improving satisfaction and perceived cooperation compared to text‑only media, though small lags and screen‑mediated cues can still hamper immediacy (Raveendhran, Zhang, & Dulebohn, 2022; Kock & Rocco, 2021).

3. **Chat / Email**  
   Text‑only (synchronous chat or asynchronous email) channels that strip away vocal tone and body language. These lean media tend to slow information exchange, reduce trust signals, and increase misinterpretation—often resulting in lower satisfaction and fewer joint gains (Parlamis & Ames, 2010; Lipp & Mohnen, 2024).

Each subsequent page will delve into one medium—exploring **what** defines it, **why** it influences negotiation differently, and **how** to adapt your tactics for optimal results.
