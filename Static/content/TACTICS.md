## Key Negotiation Tactics

In this module we’ll survey five evidence‑based tactics that form the backbone of effective corporate negotiations. Each of these strategies is supported by rigorous empirical research and will be unpacked in its own lesson:

1. **Anchoring**  
   The power of making the first offer to set the negotiation range in your favor.  
   *Core insight:* First offers exert a strong “anchor” effect on subsequent counter‑offers and final terms¹.

2. **Priority Disclosure Timing**  
   How—and when—to reveal which issues matter most to you.  
   *Core insight:* Prematurely sharing your priority structure can be exploited by a self‑interested counterpart².

3. **Integrative Bargaining**  
   Techniques for “expanding the pie” by creating value through package deals and trade‑offs.  
   *Core insight:* Collaborative, multi‑issue approaches generate larger joint gains than haggling over a single issue³.

4. **Perspective‑Taking**  
   Adopting your counterpart’s viewpoint to uncover hidden interests and craft mutually beneficial solutions.  
   *Core insight:* Negotiators trained in perspective‑taking reach better outcomes than those relying on empathy alone⁴.

5. **Team Negotiation**  
   Leveraging a diverse group of negotiators to exchange information, generate options, and manage complex deals.  
   *Core insight:* Teams outperform individuals by uncovering more integrative opportunities and balancing internal roles⁵.

In the following pages, we will explore each of these five tactics in depth—examining key studies, practical frameworks, and real‑world examples. By the end of this section, you’ll understand not only **what** these strategies are, but **why** they work and **how** to apply them in your fee and overrun negotiations.
