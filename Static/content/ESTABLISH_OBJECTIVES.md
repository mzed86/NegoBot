# Establishing Objectives: Definition, Mechanisms, and Application

### 1. What Is Establishing Objectives?  
“Establishing Objectives” is the process of **defining clear, prioritized goals** for a negotiation before you engage your counterpart. These objectives include your underlying **interests** (the “why”), your **aspiration range** (target outcomes), and your **fairness standards** (legitimacy benchmarks). In multi‑issue negotiations—such as vendor contracts or consulting fees—this step ensures you know exactly what you want, why you want it, and what you are prepared to concede.

### 2. Why It Works  
1. **Clarity and Focus**  
   - Clearly articulated objectives prevent negotiators from getting sidetracked by tactical skirmishes and keep attention on high‑value issues (Lewicki, Saunders, & Barry, 2015).  
2. **Stronger Anchors and Legitimacy**  
   - When objectives are backed by objective criteria (market data, industry benchmarks), your proposals gain legitimacy and persuasive power (Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001).  
3. **Improved Trade‑Off Decisions**  
   - A well‑structured priority list lets you make **calibrated concessions**—sacrificing low‑priority items for gains on high‑priority ones—maximizing joint value (Curhan, Elfenbein, & Xu, 2006).  
4. **Reduced Cognitive Bias**  
   - Research shows that negotiators who explicitly plan goals and limits are less prone to common biases (anchoring errors, overconfidence) and achieve better outcomes (Malhotra & Bazerman, 2007).

### 3. How to Apply “Establishing Objectives”

1. **Identify Issues and Interests**  
   - Brainstorm every conceivable issue (e.g., price, scope, timeline, liability, service levels).  
   - For each, ask: “What underlying interest does this reflect?” (e.g., risk mitigation, cash‑flow management).

2. **Prioritize Using an Issue Matrix**  
   - Create a two‑axis matrix (Importance vs. Flexibility).  
   - Plot each issue to distinguish **core objectives** (high importance, low flexibility) from **trade‑off items** (low importance, high flexibility).

3. **Set Aspiration and Reservation Levels**  
   - **Aspiration Point:** Your optimistic, yet realistic target for each core issue.  
   - **Reservation Point:** The least acceptable outcome (linked to your BATNA and fairness standards) below which you will walk away (Fisher & Ury, 1981; Pinkley, 1995).

4. **Anchor to Objective Criteria**  
   - For each objective, assemble data sources: industry reports, competitor benchmarks, historical contracts, expert appraisals.  
   - Document these in a **justification dossier** to support your opening offers and counter‑offers.

5. **Document and Communicate Internally**  
   - Produce a **one‑page negotiation brief** summarizing objectives, interests, and data points.  
   - Align your internal team (if any) on roles, messaging, and concession logic.

### Real‑World Example: IBM’s Cloud‑Services Renewal

In 2021, IBM renegotiated a multi‑year cloud‑services agreement with a large financial services firm.  
- **Issues Identified:** Pricing tier, uptime guarantees, data‑sovereignty clauses, professional‑services credits.  
- **Interest Mapping:** The client’s core interest was regulatory compliance (data‑sovereignty) and predictable budgeting (fixed pricing), while IBM prioritized long‑term commitment (contract length) and upsell opportunities.  
- **Objective Matrix:** Uptime (high importance, low flexibility); professional‑services credits (lower importance, high flexibility).  
- **Aspiration & Reservation:** IBM set an aspiration of 99.95% uptime at mid‑tier pricing, with a reservation of 99.9% at a minimal uplift.  
- **Objective Criteria:** Cited industry uptime averages (Gartner 2020), peer vendor pricing surveys, and compliance benchmarks.  
- **Outcome:** By focusing concessions on professional‑services credits (low‑priority) and holding firm on uptime, IBM secured a 3‑year contract with a 5% price increase and optional upsell clauses—exceeding both parties’ aspiration points.
