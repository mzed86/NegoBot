## Data Usage

### 1. Data Collected  
- **Roleplay Transcripts:** We capture and store the full dialogue transcripts generated during each negotiation role‑play session.

### 2. Storage Location  
- All transcripts are saved in a secured database hosted in **Sweden**, ensuring compliance with EU data protection standards.

### 3. AI Processing  
- The processing of these transcripts—text analysis, response generation, and coaching feedback—is performed via **Azure OpenAI**, predominantly within Azure regions in Sweden, as part of Microsoft’s global deployment of OpenAI models.  
- For detailed information on how Azure handles customer data, see the [Azure OpenAI Service Data Protection Addendum](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/service-data-protection-addendum).

### 4. Application Hosting  
- The application backend and database are deployed on a **Render** server located in **Frankfurt, Germany**. All Render‑hosted components adhere to Render’s Data Processing Agreement and [Privacy Policy](https://render.com/policies#data-processing).

### 5. Retention & Deletion  
- **Automatic Deletion:** All stored role‑play transcripts are automatically purged from our database **every 90 days**.  
- This retention schedule ensures that no long‑term records of your simulated negotiations are maintained beyond the prescribed period.

### 6. Compliance & Security  
- Data in transit is encrypted using TLS. Data at rest is encrypted by Azure and Render according to industry best practices.  
- You can review Azure’s broader security and privacy commitments in the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).  
- For Render’s security measures and data handling practices, refer to the [Render Security Overview](https://render.com/security).
